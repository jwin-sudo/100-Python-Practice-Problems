Exercise 50 - Text Input

Question: The code produces an error. Please understand the error and try to fix it

age = input("What's your age? ")
age_last_year = age - 1
print("Last year you were %s." % age_last_year)
Note: Please use raw_input instead of input if you are on Python 2. For Python 3 input is fine.
'''

age = input("What's your age? ")
age_last_year = int(age) - 1  # Convert input to integer before performing arithmetic
print(f"Last year you were {age_last_year}")  # This will now work correctly
